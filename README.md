# Churn Prediction
In this project, I go through the process of building a customer churn prediction system using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Tkinter for a graphical user interface (GUI). Customer churn prediction is a valuable tool for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Overview
I will create a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on several features such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and more. We will also build a simple GUI using Tkinter to input customer data and get predictions.
